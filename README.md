# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

![](Images/sql.png))

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

1. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

Note: You may hear the term "Data Modeling" in place of "Data Engineering," but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modeling.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- SQL
- CSV files
- Data modeling tools such as [Quick Database Diagrams](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com)

## Instructions

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

#### Data Engineering

- Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table, ensuring the correct order of imports.

#### Data Analysis

Once the database is complete, we'll perform the following analysis:

- List specific details of each employee.
- List employees hired in a certain period.
- List department managers.
- List the department of each employee.
- List employees by name criteria.
- List all employees in specific departments.
- List frequency count of employee last names.
